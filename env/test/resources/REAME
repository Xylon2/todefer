The database dump test_database.sql is used to create a database for testing,
which is already populated with some reasonable sample data.

In order to run your tests, you need to:
- create a test database
- create a db-credentials.edn here.
- import like this: psql -U todefer_test -d todefer_test -f test_database.sql -W -h localhost

For allowing testing `authenticate-user`, you must create a test user. See
comments in queries_test.clj.

If you need to produce a new test database, dump a dev or prod database thus:
pg_dump --no-privileges --no-owner -U username -h hostname -d dbname -f db_dump.sql

Now (with AI assistance) edit the dump to replace these text fields with lorem ipsum:
  - column page_name of table apppage
  - column cat_name of table defcatnamed
  - column habit_name of table habit
  - column task_name of table task
  - column password of table users

Now, for "task" page 1, ensure that:
- there are exactly 5 tasks deferred to a date
- those dates are very far in the future
- those dates are all different

Now, for habit page 13, ensure that:
- there are exactly 5 habits not yet due
- those dates are very far in the future
- those dates are all different
